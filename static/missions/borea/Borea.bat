@echo New Republic Operatives have arranged for you to enter the heavily
@echo guarded Borean System in the Galorndon Cluster. Your mission is to
@echo infiltrate High Imperial Command's headquarters on the Planet Borea and
@echo steal the data-tapes which contain the technical readouts of the
@echo Empire's new Sovereign-Class Star Destroyer, the Despot. Once the
@echo tapes have been secured, you are to make your way back to your ship for
@echo immediate departure.
