<p>
Just like everything else, TV, movies, levels, etc, I need to make sure that everybody who helped out around here gets some mention.  Because nobody got paid, nobody got other perks, they just decided to be nice, have some fun(though I guess that's open to debate) and help out around the Nest.  So take some time and look through the names so these people get the credit they deserve. What I say will undoubtedly fall short of what they've done to help out, but....

<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>Jereth Kok</b></font> - This guy is probably the first person outside of my family that heard about the Nest, and he gave me encouragement to keep it running even after other sites(his included) popped up around the web.  He stopped by to provide some valuable feedback in the very begining.  And now months later we're setting up an internationally coordinated effort to review and provide access to the add-on levels forthcoming for Jedi Knight at the Academy.  Jereth has given help with the site, with Dark Forces in general, and has just been a great guy to talk to about anything that comes up in our email conversations.
<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>Bryant Luk</b></font> - Aside from running swgamers.com and letting me link to his files, Bryant has been a great source of information and inspiration.  Being kind enough to return my early emails was just the beginning; he's let me fool in Photoshop to provide some graphics for him, given me some really nice publicity for the Nest by noting when I updated it and now we've got a pretty nice working partnership going between the sites.
<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>Lionel Fouillen</b></font> - Author of the great Archangel levels, he's also been nice enough to send me all the files he creates for his levels so I can keep the Components section up to date and to keep me informed of other developments.  And he's provided support for the Nest and my other schemes in many other ways.
<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>David Lovejoy</b></font> - Do I really need to mention all that this guy has done for the community?  Everyone knows about the Ackbar pages and his work on WDFUSE, not everyone knows about everything else he's done behind the scenes.  David also saved me a ton of time in indexing the files so I could set up the components section.
<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>Yves Borckmans</b></font> - The author of DFUSE and WDFUSE, and now a worker at LucasArts.  If it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't have seen even half of the levels currently available, and the quality most likely wouldn't be close either.  The few conversations we had were always interesting and informative about all sorts of different things.
<p>
<font color="#1FE071"><b>George Lucas</b></font> - There's no way I could leave him off.  Never met him, probably never will, but he's been more of an inspiration and source of endless entertainment and ideas than anyone else to this point in my life.  Not that this will ever reach him, but Thank You.
<p>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<font face="EngraversGothic BT"><h3>And...</h3></font>
All the level authors because without them I wouldn't have a site to run.  Keep the ideas flowing and the levels coming guys!
<p>
LucasArts for turning out a great game.  I applaud your efforts to provide some good fun and at the same time put out a solid game that does more than just let us run around and shoot.  This game went to new heights and there are many aspects that still haven't been matched, much less beaten.  Not for another month anyway. 
<p>
Friends and family of course.
<p>
Everyone else that has even a remote interest in Dark Forces, that has ever hit the site and has ever written me even a short note; this site wouldn't be here if I didn't think it could be of some use to you.
