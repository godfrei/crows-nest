Here you can find a history of the updates to the Nest. As this gets longer I'll begin removing items from the bottom of the list.  Each bit is marked with the date of the update.
<p>
<hr noshade>
<p>
<font color="#FF0000" face="EngraversGothic BT"><b>September 17, 1997</b></font> - I fixed the link to Fortress Dantooine that I screwed up yesterday, sorry to those who tried to download that.  And I also added about 10-12 levels I found while looking through <a href="http://www.swgamers.com/" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Go to swgamers.com.'; return true">swgamers.com</a>.  If the date in  <a href="storage.html" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true" onmouseover="window.status='Download levels and other files.';return true">Storage</a> says Aug/97 or later, then you can probably bet it's new.  From what I was noticing they appear to be mostly Mac levels, so it's possible you've never tried them before.  Check them out if you want.
<p>
I got my first message from someone using Internet Explorer 3.x today, commenting on the new design.  All the pages use the Javascript Image descriptor, which Microsoft JScript doesn't support.  I'm told that IE4 will work fine, but in the meantime, does anyone know of a way to make browsers that don't support a tag not use it?  I don't want people getting an error message when the come just because of the browser they use.  All comments and suggestions on that are welcome.
<p>
Got any levels that you think should be reviewed next?  Or news on forthcoming levels?  I almost always enjoy hearing from people, so mail me your opinions/ideas/comments/files.
<p>
<font color="#FF0000" face="EngraversGothic BT"><b>September 16, 1997</b></font> - First, that news I mentioned yesterday.  Lionel Fouillen contacted me with news about his Archangel Part III.  He says that he found time and creativity enough to work on it more and it will be available in October.  Apparently there's been some concern that the series was never to be finished; Lionel asked me to help clear that up.  So never fear!  Also, hopefully there will be a new level out this weekend; it looks promising to me.
<p>
I don't think I mentioned it, and it might be old news, but Peter Klassen made some cutscenes for Assassinate Darth Vader.  I've tried them and they're very cool.  Grab them from the review or in Storage.
<p>
Today I added a new review of <a href="wolf.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the review of Castle Wolfenstein.'; return true">Castle Wolfenstein</a> and linked it and Fortress Dantooine, a level from David Lovejoy, for download in <a href="storage.html" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true" onmouseover="window.status='Download levels and other files.';return true">Storage</a>.  You should check them out if you get a chance!
<p>
<img src="images/award3.gif" align="right" width="125" height="135"><font color="#FF0000" face="EngraversGothic BT"><b>September 15, 1997</b></font> - The Nest received another award while I was on vacation.  It's been given the Bein's World Award for being a cool site.  I'm going to nee to set up an extra section for these!
<p>
The second issue of Darkness Falls is out!  For those who don't yet know, Darkness Falls is a monthly online magazine devoted to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight.  It features interviews, level info and inside news.  You can find it at <a href="<a href="http://www.st.nepean.uws.edu.au/~jwalters/index.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Go to Bespin - The CLoud City.'; return true">Bespin - The Cloud City</a>.
<p>
News from the Nest - there are two new reivews, again from Steve Noall and myself.  This time we've reviewed <a href="jedinight.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the reviews of A Jedi Night.'; return true">A Jedi Night</a>.
<p>
I also fixed some links to levels, thank you to those who mailed me concerning them.
<p>
<font color="#FF0000" face="EngraversGothic BT"><b>September 14, 1997</b></font> - As promised, some new updates today. First I have awarded <a href="parux.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the review of Energy Mine on Parux.'; return true">Energy Mine on Parux</a> and <a href="mtkurek.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the review of Mt. Kurek.'; return true">Mt. Kurek</a> Editor's Choice Awards, meaning that they are among the best Dark Forces Add-On missions you can find.  If you haven't yet, I suggest you read their reviews and then download them.
<p>
Also there are two new reviews of a fairly new mission, <a href="rock.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the review of The Rock - Gandolo IV.'; return true">The Rock - Gandolo IV</a>, the first of a series if I remember correctly.  The level is also set up for you to download from either <a href="storage.html" onmouseout="window.status=' ';return true" onmouseover="window.status='Download levels and other files.';return true">Storage</a> or from the review page.
<p>
Lastly, past updates and new are now found on the <a href="history.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onmouseover="window.status='Read the History to learn about past updates and news.'; return true">History</a> page.  Everything new is still here at the front, but now there's a page you can look through if you missed something.  You'll always be able to find a link to it in either the <a href="database.html" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onMouseOver="window.status='Access the Database to find information on Dark Forces and the Nest.';return true">Database</a> or at the bottom of this page.
<p>
<font color="#FF0000" face="EngraversGothic BT"><b>September 13, 1997</b></font>
<br>The Nest is up to full speed again, after a month of revamps.  Jedi Knight is fast approaching and the Academy will be picking up again soon, so I need to return to my goal of completing the Review List and finishing up the Database before JK eats up all my free time.
<p>
First off, all the new stuff will be posted here(which is now the very front page) to eliminate the need to jump to a different area just to see what's updated.  So to begin in that new fashion, I'll announce the other big changes here.  First, the Nest has an entirely new look!  I attempted to use a new style that binds it together a bit better and also work in a few 'cool' things to liven it up.  Also, the Components section has been renamed as Storage, which will coincide with a new site that I'm working on to hold some add-on missions for alternate downloading.  There are only a couple new files today(what give it all to you at once?); but I do have more new Reviews, Missions and files ready to link, so return in the coming days to find what's still going on in the Dark Forces community!
<p>
Every page at the Nest has now been checked to ensure accuracy, quality and all that jazz.  As always, if you find anything wrong or missing, want to contribute to the Nest, or have a question, please <a href="mailto:godfrei@saul.u.washington.edu" onmouseout="window.status=' '; return true" onMouseOver="window.status='Mail me at godfrei@saul.u.washington.edu';return true" >mail me</a>.
