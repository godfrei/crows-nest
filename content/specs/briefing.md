title: BRIEFING.LST
---

[by Nicola Salmoria]

In DARK.GOB we have the file BRIEFING.LST, its contents are trivial:

```
LEV   name of the level
LFD   name of the .LFD file to take the briefing from
ANI   name of the ANIM (in the .LFD file) to use as background
PAL   the palette to use
```

[It seems that LFD containing briefings and objective screens must be called DFBRIEF.LFD, or the PDA won't work properly - Jereth]
