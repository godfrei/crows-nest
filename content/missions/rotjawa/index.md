description: "The Rebellion has found another secret Imperial base to dispose of. This base is being used to train Jawas to be stormtroopers because, after the bad PR of losing two Death Stars, the Empire is desperate for recruits. The Empire has realized that building self-destruct mechanisms into every base is a bad idea, and Kyle Katarn is called upon to disable the base's defenses so the Rebel fleet can nuke the site from above."
