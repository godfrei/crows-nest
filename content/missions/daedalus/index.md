description: "
Your job is to infiltrate one of the Emperor's Hammer base platforms. You are to find the plans containing information on Fleet activity and what kind of a threat the Hammer is. Once this is done you'll be picked up by an Assault Transport in the hangar. Be warned: the mission is tough, and it is suggested you find the plans and leave immediately rather than stay and confront the entire base."
