description: "The Imperials are updating their stormtrooper weaponry and armor. They are currently conducting tests of a new jetpack on the Star Destroyer Oppressor IV. Your job is to bring pack one of the jetpacks, and the plans for their design. You copilot Jan was captured soon after sending us this information, so you will need to break her out as well. You will also have to be on guard because Emperor Palpatine's twin brother is supposedly on board."
