From the moment you walk through the landing pad door at the start of this level you can tell that a lot of work has gone into making this level accurately resemble the Bespin from The Empire Strikes Back. The architecture for this level is simply breath-taking, out of all levels made, no other level captures the SW universe this well....you'd swear you're in the movie, expecting to see Lando, Han & Leia strolling down the corridors at any time.

There are dozens of locations in this level that are straight from the movie, the machine room where C3PO was almost burnt to ashes.....the walkway where Luke and Darth Vader fought......the room with the long table where Darth was seated waiting for Han & Leia....the list goes on. Every single location has a feel of it's own with virtually no repetition of design.

It is hard to find faults in this level, but if you wanted to nit-pick you could say that for the most part it wasn't very hard at all, the only dangerous foe being a Phase One DT on Boba Fett's landing pad who is easily killed by shooting out the window without having to confront. The story behind the level has weak points, but is adequate enough.

The level contains numerous new waxes which are mostly very good, particularly Lobot, though the Ugnaught does look kinda awkward. The few puzzles in the level aren't too frustrating or distracting and are well thought out. The level lacks a mission briefing LFD, but this was made in the early days when that wasn't possible, so don't make the mistake of thinking that it is a fault.

## Overall

Overall, this level is just simply special, and few levels can approach it's architectual design and atmosphere. What makes it more special yet is that it was one of the first made, and the level-making tools available weren't as good as they are today.
