This is one of the few levels which attempts to recreate scenes from the Star Wars movies. And so far it is the one which does the best job. The story is really quite pointless; the discrepancies are so numerous and obvious that it's really just an excuse for the player to get to work in Bespin. But that's really all it needs to be.

To the best of their ability, the authors have made the players stay in Bespin every bit as satifying as if he/she were watching The Empire Strikes Back. The colors are accurate, the architecture reasonably close, and some of the scenes are incredibly reminiscient of the movie. If you look out a window you can scan the Bespin skyline; I was half expecting a cloudcar to fly by. The carbon freezing chamber is nicely done, with low lighting and that wonderful orange glow coming through the floor. And there's also a view from a window from which you can look out over the catwalk where Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker battled and Skywalker lost his hand. It sends a tingle down your spine to be transported into the movies.

There are also several new waxes placed periodically throughout the level to complete the setting. There's a cloudcar pilot to replace the commando, and Lando's cyborg assisstant is here too. The best thing about the waxes is that they've been based on existing files, so the animation for their deaths is smooth. The logic they use is easily transferable from LucasArts created sets as well. There are also a few new waxes that don't quite set the tone so well. There's a bonus file included for systems with more than 8 megs of RAM. It has some more waxes which include a blue Gammorean Guard and a six-limbed phase 1 Dark Trooper that's supposed to be a gundark as far as I can tell. They don't bring anything special to the environment, and as far as I'm concerned they take away a bit of the Star Wars environment with their briliant colors. They just don't seem to fit in.

The largest problem in the level, no matter what system you run it on, is the plotline. Not only would Moff Rebus have been transferred to a detention center for permenant housing long ago, but Boba Fett is dead as well, no matter whether you go by the Dark Forces timeline or try to make it fit with the Trilogy. And the prescence of the Dark Trooper can't be explained away for 8 meg systems. Lots of pieces feel like they've been added as an excuse, as I already mentioned, for the player to visit Cloud City. And if you only want to take it that far, then it's great; I have to admit that when I heard the voice of Boba Fett talking with the control tower over the intercom, I liked the nice touch. But if you want a really great experience, a level requires a good plot, and Bespin doesn't provide that.

## Overall

With regards to the amount of effort put into this level by the authors, and the dramatic touches that keep the level interesting, there's really no way that Bespin can provide less than a positive experience for the user. It could use some work, but it's fun just the same.
