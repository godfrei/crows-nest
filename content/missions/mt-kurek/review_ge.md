I was a fairly extensive Beta tester for this level, so I don't feel right in doing a proper review. But I have a few comments to make that hopefully won't spoil it for you. This level has some very incredible new items in it. The INF work that went in is unbelievable(can the DF engine go much further?) and the story, while perhaps a bit strained is still interesting and fresh. The added bit of the volcano will provide plenty of interesting surprises. And I'll warn you now that the ending is so climatic that you'll be sweating. I personally let out a big "YEAH!" after playing this the first time, such was the rush. I've never done that before on any level; so I can recommend you check this out, because you won't be disappointed.

I have to mention a couple things that no one else has noted yet. The first is the music. With all the special attention paid to detail in the level, the music seems to have been overlooked. The author used the music from the Sewers, level 3 in the original game and easily the worst music you'll find in there. When you're looking for an ominous sounding beginning and later some good action music you only get some medium happy sounding stuff. It ruins the mood whenever you have the chance to stop and listen. Thankfully that isn't often. My second thing to mention is the incredible storm that takes place throughout the level. Everyone seems so overcome by the ending that they fail to notice the contribution to the atmosphere made by the thunder and lightning. Subtle, but very effective.
