This is the second mission from the Hammer's Fist, a group of add-on levels creators who decided to make you play the role of a stormtrooper instead of Kyle Katarn. This alone deserves to be encouraged, for it shows one way among others to set farther the limits of the game, and to challenge the player on unexploited gaming territories. The briefing is personalized, with typical colors, Imperial insigna and mission reference code. Once you're in the game, you can appreciate to see that Kyle's hands were replaced with stormtrooper ones, which demonstrates that the author paid attention to the every single detail.

The opening sequence of the mission is impressive, featuring full-scale FME dewbacks and a stormtrooper platoon awaiting nearby. The author created new sky and background textures to simulate the boundless extent of the Jundland Wastes. Light and shadings were calculated to render a realistic atmosphere of troopers having to endure the anvil of the sun. Then it's up to the player to explore all surrounding canyons to try and recover the A-Wing. A good point here is that there is no hint that could lead you straight to the goal. Often, you may then wonder what you're going to find out after each corner. The canyons are the best I've ever seen in a DF level. Their architecture is most realistic and features a hazardous configuration that makes them even more true-to-life. Appropriate wall lighting and shading plus a new excellent rock texture add to the overall scenery, and you will appreciate the cool of the deepest parts of the canyons. They could be a nice place to rest if you weren't suddenly attacked by their hostile inhabitants. Tusken raiders and Jawas abound, staking out both in concealed caves and on terraces. The two distinct Tusken WAXes are very poor but the level author can't be blamed for that because they're simply not his.

After finding the abandoned A-Wing, you'll come across a sandcrawler, the best sandcrawler ever created in a DF level. Although you're not supposed to expect a sandcrawler (but you know about it just because you've read this review !!!), it adds to the unpredictability of the level, and breaks the monotony of the Jundland canyons. The vehicle exterior has beautiful textures and is well structured, although it looks a bit small compared to what was shown in the Star Wars (TM) motion picture. The author's interpretation of the interior is very believable, but there, more could have been done by recreating parts of it that were shown in the film. The interior here mainly consists of small corridors with adequate texturing and appropriate atmosphere, but without the variety of room configuration that can be expected in such a huge vehicle. Also, the use of JABSHIP.PAL for color palette damages some textures, but only specialists will notice. The mission ends in a quiet sudden way, after the player almost got thrashed by a nasty boss.

## Overall

In a few words, I would say that negative aspects of the level consist of some technical stuff that was clumsily used (such as the NO WALL - HORIZON flag to simulate endless sectors, and the unadequate color palette). Also, the sandcrawler quickly runs short of interesting rooms to visit. Hopefully, positive aspects of this level are in higher quantity: a good script with nice development, realistic new textures, impressive architecture, and a Jundland Wastes level that turns out to be the best Jawa sandcrawler mission. This level is a must play for those of you who're willing to meet again the extraordinary world of Tatooine, all with the excitment and personalization a DF level can offer. Even if it isn't perfect, you will enjoy it and store it on your hard disk as a classic.
