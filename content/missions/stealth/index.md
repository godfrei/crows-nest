description: "This level is meant to replace the Tak Base level, and has the same plot. Imperials have destroyed the Rebel base in the city of Talay with their new weapon, the Dark Trooper. You are needed to find some evidence of this weapon. The power is still off, so you will need to turn it on. The Imperials have had a week to prepare themselves, so beware."
