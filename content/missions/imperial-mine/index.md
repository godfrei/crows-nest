description: "An old underground Jedi training facility on the planet Debo has been discovered by the Emperor! Ancient Jedi Scrolls have long told the story of a perfect lightsaber jewel. It is believed that Yoda hid the jewel in a Jedi training facility. Kyle must make his way into the mine, find the yet undiscovered Jedi training areas, and retrieve the jewel.  What Kyle does not know is that the training facility, though old, is still functional."
