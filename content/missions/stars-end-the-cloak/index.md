description: "Shunned by the Empire and most of the galaxy after the defeat of his brother Rom in the Dark Trooper conflict, Thon Mohc has retreated to Mytus VII, a prison planet otherwise known as Stars End. There he has enlisted the help of smugglers in preparing a new weapon: a cloaking device small enough to be worn by a single man. Your job is to penetrate the training facility, find some information on where Thon is getting his construction materials, and then blow the place to bits."
