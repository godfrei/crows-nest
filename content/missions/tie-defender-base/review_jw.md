This is one of my favourites and regarded by a lot of people as the best add-on level. What really sets this level apart from others is the atmosphere created by the numerous intricate VUEs the author has made. They are all smooth and extremely precise in construction and makes you want to sit back and admire them.

The VUE of the TIE fighter flying patrol down the river gully, then entering the base is just beautiful. The smaller VUEs in a control room that has several rotating model ships are a terrific idea and very nicely done.

This is definitely one of the bigger levels with many different locations to visit that you don't HAVE to in order to finish the game. This means that the more times you play it you often discover new things and places which is rarely seen in most levels that often FORCE you to visit everywhere in order to finish. Some might see this as a fault, but I like it as it means that each time you play it you can take a different path to the last time you played it.

The level is pretty well constructed architectually, but there are better. And the texturing is good, not great, but you don't really notice these facts in this level as you would in another. One problem is that there are too many Dark Troopers and the Hunter Killer probe droid is easily the hardest foe in ANY level.

The tricky elevator sequence where the Sequencer Charge is located, is well thought out if a bit frustrating, especially considering you have to fight a literal army of Dark Troopers in this part. The ending is just terrific with TIEs zooming over your head as you fight off the last few Dark Troopers.


## Overall

As said at the start, what really makes the level is the countless, beautifully created VUEs; it's a pity more levels released since this one haven't duplicated this visual effect. A classic level, extremely enjoyable.
