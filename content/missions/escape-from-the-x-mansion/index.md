description: "You wake up suddenly to hear the sound of a laser battle somewhere in the rebel base where you and Jan are spending the night.  You reach under your pillow for the pistol you always keep there.  The sounds of blaster fire cease, and you fear the worst.  Imperials must have invaded the base!"
