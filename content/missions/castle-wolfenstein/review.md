Are you seriously expecting anything out of this level? Don't. This is a rehash of the original Wolfenstein level, which translates into 90 degree architecture, boring texturing(nods to those who hate it when I gripe about that :-) ), identical lighting schemes, minimal difficulty and a really short level with dubious objectives. Kill everything in sight and get out in under 1 minute is the goal that I place for you.

This might have been somewhat interesting if the author had decided to take advantage of the new engine provided him and do a Wolfenstein level the way it could have been. But instead this level only serves to bring up old memories, not necessarily pleasant ones at that.

## Overall

It's not necessarily the author's fault that this level is bad. It's from a game which by current industry standards is archaic. I didn't much care for the original game, and am much happier working my way through one of the more recent levels. I think you would be too.
