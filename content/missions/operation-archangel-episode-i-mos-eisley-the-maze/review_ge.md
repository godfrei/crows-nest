I'll add my own comments in here. The author has done an absolutely fantastic job on this level. The textures he's come up with are great, and the subtle shading used in areas is really incredible. I can't imagine how much time this must have taken. If you want an example of how to give your level an added sense of realism, this is where to look.

The link for download now points to a newer version of the level. Some of the textures and FMEs have been modified. Thanks go to Lionel for pointing me toward the updated version.

Also, the second part of the set is available, has been reviewed and is linked for download. Check out [Operation Archangel Episode II - Dungeons of Gamorra](/missions/archang2).
