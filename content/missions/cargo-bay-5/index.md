description: "A while ago Kyle and Jan discovered a Cargo Bay in the Barra Galaxy, and some X-Wing scouts found it to be an Imperial center for weapons and Dark Trooper shipping. Crix Madine was sent in to gather information, but was captured. Your job is to get him out before his scheduled execution. The cargo is already gone, so you can forget about it. You'll have to be careful because the bounty hunters hired to help with the cargo are still around, awaiting their compensation."
