They have sent a team to kill the inhabitants of the monastary and secure the plans for their construction. One of the monks managed to escape, and has contacted the Alliance with details of the Empire's attack. As Kyle Katarn, you are sent to recover the plans of the items' construction, and load the remaining Revives and Extra Lives into your ship."
