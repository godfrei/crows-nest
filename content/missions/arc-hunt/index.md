description: "A twisted mass of metal hanging in space is all that remains of the Arc Hammer.... more than there should be. Now the Executor has docked with the ship, and the Empire is crawling over the wreckage in search of the blueprints for the Dark Troopers. You, Kyle Katarn, are the only member of the Alliance to have been aboard the Arc Hammer, and so you are being detailed to board the ship, find the plans, and then attempt to shut down the shields of the Executor, opening it to Alliance attack."
