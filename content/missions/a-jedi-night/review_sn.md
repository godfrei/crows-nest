The idea of playing the role of a Jedi Knight during the Clone Wars was fun, but the level itself is a big letdown. The level is basically just the level Imperial City with one new WAX. The new WAX is a just Boba Fett with stormtrooper logic. I have to say that the WAX does fit perfectly into the level, since the Clone Wars were fought between Jedi Knights and Mandalorian Warriors. I'm just grateful the author had sense enough to use stormtrooper logic for the Mandalorians, rather than Boba Fett logic.

Another letdown in the level is that the author didn't even try to improve Imperial City by adding new puzzles or something, he just added new enemies. Without spoiling the level, let me just tell you to be ready for a big surprise at the end of the level.

## Overall

If you liked the level Imperial City, then you'll absolutely love this level. On the other hand, if you didn't like that level, I suggest you stay clear of this one. I still can't get over the fact that the author didn't at least try to improve Imperial City with new puzzles or something, instead of just adding new enemies.
