description: "The Rebel High Command has learned that the Dark Troopers are powered by a small yet powerful energy chip.  This chip is manufactured at an unknown location.  However, the chips are energized at a secret facility, code named Power Station Zeta. The destruction of this facility seems to be the only way to slow down the destruction and terror that these new weapons of the Empire are causing."
