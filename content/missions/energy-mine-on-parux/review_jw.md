You know how sometimes you get a level that's been hyped up and you're sure will be great, but turns out to be ordinary.........well this level is the oppostie.

I'd played this author's previous two levels a couple of times and while they had the odd interesting part they were fairly ordinary. Bearing this in mind, I wasn't getting my hopes up when I downloaded this level, especially because the name - Energy Mine on Parux - is hardly an innovative attention grabber.

I'm very pleased to say I was totally wrong, this level is excellent. The design is for the larger part very good and texturing mistakes are rare, as are clipping problems with only one I could find. The level has a unique atmosphere that is very electric. The new rock and sky textures are beautifully done and enhance the level's setting. The level's puzzles aren't too frustrating, but the level does require some thinking to finish.

This level doesn't have a lot of VUEs, but there wasn't too much call for them in a level like this. The level has been given a pretty good storyline and it has been integrated into the level design well, so that the mine's design doesn't feel like room after room without a purpose, but rather a well designed facility. A lot of scenes really worked well, like when you come to a cliff and are able to see a part of the mine you haven't been yet matched with a cool sound effect that provides a daunting feeling of what's to come.

The architecture of the level is fresh and the author has managed to take ordinary things like elevators and make new interesting designs. There isn't too much repettion of design, and each location has it's own design features that seperate it from other areas of the level.

## Overall

This level really surprised me, the jump in quality from it's predecessors is dramatic, and I recommend you play it as soon as possible. It's just a step or two down from the really top-notch levels. The author of this level shows a lot of talent and creativity, definitely someone to label 'Watch this spot'.
