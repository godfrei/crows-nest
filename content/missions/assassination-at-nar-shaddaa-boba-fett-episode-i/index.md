description: "You play the part of Boba Fett. You have just been hired by your long time client Jabba The Hutt
to take care of some business in the city of Nar Shaddaa. It seems an arrogant young relative of his named Priga has been
muscling in on Jabba's trade. Priga's been making quite a name for himself on the Smugglers Moon, and Jabba is not happy. 
Rather than share his trade with Priga, Jabba has decided that the galaxy isn't big enough for the both of them. Jabba has 
hired you to assassinate Priga the Hutt."
