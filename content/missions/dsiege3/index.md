description: "Imperial forces have recently taken total control over the Reora Spaceport on planet Torax. Reora is known to be a favorite spaceport of dignitaries, VIPs, and many of the other powerful authorities. The Empire recently kidnapped one of those VIPs: Mark Lenor, and his royal family is devastated. Imperials plan to exchange his life for the planet Rubai, which the Lenors currently control. We have yet to determine why the Empire is after that planet, but for now we must focus on Mark Lenor's safe rescue only."
