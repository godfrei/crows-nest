description: "Some time ago Fortress Dantooine had to be evacuated after a crushing Imperial attack. The Empire has built a new facility next to the ruins of the fortress. Some rebel spys still hiding out at the ruins have located the data for the newest Battle Moon the empire is planning to construct. Although this Battle Moon has no super laser like a Death Star, it is protected by a powerful computer network which controls all aspects of defense, both externally and internally. We need to analyze the data to find a way to breach the computer security."
