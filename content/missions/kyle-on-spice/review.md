The entire world swirls with nifty colors and you have trouble staying on your feet. Motion is difficult and it seems like everything is moving in different directions. You're attacked by floating green men who seem to be there and not there at the same time. And for some reason Jan isn't her usual cheerful self.

Yep, it's definitely Kyle on spice. The texturing is atrocious, the enemy placement is really awful, and there isn't a semblance of reality throughout the entire level. It's absolutely perfect.

## Overall

This level is fun to grab for a quick spin. There isn't a whole lot of replay value in it; once you try it it's not quite the same the second time. Some people might argue that it serves to humorize drug use, but thankfully the authors were sharp-minded enough to add their own warning about that. You should grab this just to check it out.
