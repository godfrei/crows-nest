description: "The Rebels have completed their evacuation of Hoth with the exception of one man, Marcus Alliance, High Commander of the Corellian sector. He is presumably hiding somewhere in the many ice caves that surround the base. The initial Imperial invasion force has been replaced with regular stormtrooper squads, and what have been to referred to as \"Super Stormtroopers,\" possibly Dark Troopers. These will be accompanied by large numbers of Probe Droids, so be cautious."
