description: "The Battle of Endor is long passed, and the Empire is struggling to keep what is left of it's former glory. Admirals are seizing territories and trying to reestablish trade routes. One of their key routes runs through the Anoat System, in particular through Bespin and Cloud City. While en route to a New Republic Detention center, General Crix Madine and his captive, Moff Rebus are pulled out of hyperspace by Imperial Interdictors. Two escort B-Wings arrive at Coruscant with the news that Madine and Rebus are headed to Cloud City where Madine is to be sealed in carbonite. The New Republic sends Katarn and Jan to rescue Madine, recapture Moff Rebus, and find any information concerning Imperial trade routes in the area. Little does Kyle know that as he speeds to Cloud City, so does Slave I and Boba Fett, dispatched by the Empire to finish off Katarn once and for all."
