description: "Despite Kyle Katarn's courageous efforts in repelling the Dark Trooper threat, it has become obvious that the Imperials are continuing to manufacture the robotic monstrosities. At the same time, Alliance Intelligence has noted increased Imperial activity over the planet Fest. Seeing that they believe the two are connected somehow, you are being sent to the planet to see what you can discover."
