description: "It is ten days before the destruction of the second Death Star. The Rebellion has called upon you to steal the code that will drop the shields to the Death Star and also to steal an Imperial shuttle for use by a Rebel team to sneak down to the shield generator. A previous Rebel saboteur has found a drop point for you (in the sewer outside the complex) and has made the area a weapons cache. Sadly, nothing has been heard from this source lately..."
