This level is a worthy successor to Episode 1: Mos Eisley - The Maze. It continues on with the strong story line which although not entirely original plays a strong part in the success of both levels.
The introduction of the new character, Riia Goltend, helps to add interest and a new mission goal to what could have easily been the well worn story of get the new weapon and get out. Not that rescuing the girl is that unique either but the combination of goals plus the added personality of the character works really well. Although Riia only appears as static FME image she makes her presence felt with some well placed dialogue provided by the voice of Muriel Ost. This girl has all the attitude of Princess Leia - and even one of her lines.

Being set in a castle like fortress the texturing reminds me of some of the early Doom or Quake levels but you soon get back to the traditional DF look in the areas of the fortress which have been converted by the Imperial forces. It's a nice contrast of technology with traditional building methods which I felt made for a believable location in the DF universe.

What really sets this level apart and makes it a must play is the under water section. You should look at this level just for that alone. It's an idea that is so easy to do yet it's surprising no one has really attempted it until now. What's more in this level the concept is done so well it is entirely believable. With added sound effects you really do feel like you are underwater.

However the water section while impressive is not the only great aspect of this level. The new weapon is truly that - a completely new weapon. Designed by Vincent Hubin I would have to place it as the best weapon ever designed for DF. I could easily see Kyle replacing his Bryar with a Black Whirlwind. While it is said to have been designed for Dark Trooper use, having experienced the weapon it 'feels' like it would be very light weight and easy to carry. That said it packs all the punch of much heavier weapons and is very effective in a tight situation - unlike Bosk's concussion rifle. A joy to use against any of your favorite opponents.

One other area that really stood out for me was the location of the Black Whirlwind. It's a well designed area which I felt achieved something that is really lacking in many custom levels - unpredictability. That is all I will say about it otherwise the location will become expected and predictable.

There are so many details in this level and none of the work has been unnecessary. The flaming torches lighting the corridors, the well placed candelabra above a table which looks great. There is also the Gamorrean Guard arms and shield texture which really helps to define the fortress as being originally owned by the Gamorrean race. Plus Allen Newman, who created quite a few textures for this level, has also put his sound mixing skills into practice with a few new lines of dialogue for Kyle and Jan.


## Overall

Overall this level plays really well. It's not too easy nor overly hard. Technically there is very little I can fault with this level. Most of what I find to be questionable is really my personal opinion on whether something fits in with the level story line or not. For that reason I won't waste words on these questionable points. There is enough reason here for you to try this level and the good points really are worth experiencing. If you want to see a well designed level then this will not let you down. It builds on the first episode and is shaping up as one of the best multi-level projects on the web.
