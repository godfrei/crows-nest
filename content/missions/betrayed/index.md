description: "Lieutenant Commander Brit Dannon has just been given a new assignment on the Moonbase, a relatively insignificant Republic Supply and Transfer Station some distance from the Imperial Border.  The station itself holds little tactical advantage, and is not considered a primary target fot Imperial attack.  It is staffed by about 300 personnel and droids at all times.  The station is well known to anyone who cares to know of it, though most Republic personnel still know little of its existance beyond their own personal contact with the facility.  Rumors abound that the Empire has some interest in the base, but you can't help but wonder what interest would the Moonbase have for anyone.  The answers lie ahead."
