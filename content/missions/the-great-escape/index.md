description: "En route to Hoth in an unmarked space yacht, your ship is set upon by bounty hunters led by Boba Fett and IG-88, and you and Jan are captured. You are taken to the Imperial prison facility known as Justice Station, along with your newest toy, a jetpack. The bounty hunters claimed salvage rights on your ship and took it to their base on the planet below, and the stolen plans for the new Imposer Class Star Destroyer are still hidden aboard it. Your job is to rescue Jan, recover the jetpack, and then make your way down to the planet to retrieve the stolen plans before leaving."
