description: "You've been working at home on your own Dark Forces level, and are setting some flags in the starting sector to values that had never been tried before.  There's a blinding light, and you suddenly find yourself in an abomination of your own house.  You realize that the Jedi Engine has sucked you in, and turned your house into a Dark Forces level.  You know what to do: your goal is to get the Death Star plans, and get out."
