description: "Rebel spies have located the base where research and development is being done on the Empire's newest starfighter, the TIE Defender.  This development effort is being led by Admiral Thrawn, who is reporting directly to the Emperor.  Initial analysis indicates that this new weapon can outrun and outgun any starfighter in the Rebel arsenal.  The Rebel Alliance needs more data on this craft and we need to shut down its testing facility."
