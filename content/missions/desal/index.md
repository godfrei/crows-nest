description: "On an overcast afternoon, Kyle sets down on one of the supply moons of Coruscant to disable and deactivate an ecological nightmare created by the Imperials to supply water to Coruscant. Years of cheap but bio-ridiculous procedures have left the moon a lifeless hulk and the plant itself a half-functioning, rusty shell of what it once was. It is hoped that sabotaging this plant will help the Rebellion to gain recruits through this demonstration of ecological concern."
