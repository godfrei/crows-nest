description: "Soon after the fall of Coruscant it was discovered that Admiral Kraken in charge of Imperial data storage managed to escape Alliance detection with a copy of the Phase I Dark Trooper blueprints. Rumor has it he is improving upon the original models, giving them new weapons. Your job is to get inside his facility and blow it up. Beware: intelligence indicates an abundance of traps and mercenaries throughout the base."
