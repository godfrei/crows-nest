description: "Shortly after you retrieved the Nava Card containing smuggler routes to the Arc Hammer from Nar Shaddaa, you received notice that the information had been split onto TWO cards shortly before you arrived. The second was taken to Commenor Spaceport by Cycy Loctob. Your job is to track it down. You are also to retrieve a sample of what is believed to be a companion alloy to the Phrik Metal, known as Deusanium. Be warned: General Mohc is also believed to be in the vicinity of the Spaceport."
