description: "Commander, the Rebel Alliance recently intercepted several sensitive Imperial transmisions.  We are afraid most of this information has already been passed on to the Rebel High Command.  It is no longer possible to prevent them from using the data, however the Emperor believes we might still obtain a copy of the data hidden in a relatively small rebel baseon the moon Archon.  Don't let the size of the base fool you, it is well protected.  Your mission officer will fill you in further when you reach the moon.  Beta team will provide cover for your escape.  Our mission is primarily damage assessment now. Recover the hidden data tape and meet up with Beta team outside the base."
