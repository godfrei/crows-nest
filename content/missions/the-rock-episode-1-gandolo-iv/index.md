description: "Joruus C'baoth has defected from Grand Admiral Thrawn, along with two divisions of Thrawn's troops. These are no ordinary troops though. The two divisions consist of specially trained stormtroopers, officers, and even a few Dark Jedi. Your mission is to infiltrate C'baoth's base on Gandolo IV, and find proof of a weapons system that C'baoth has found."
