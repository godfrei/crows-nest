description: "The assault on the SunKiller platform was a complete success. Minutes after you lowered the energy shield, Alliance fighters moved in, damaging the platform beyond repair.  The Emperor, needless to say, was not pleased.  He summoned Senj Thirtrae who survived the attack despite substantial damage to the Lentii base) to Imperial City for a face-to-face meeting.  Rebel spies have determined that after a mild scolding for his funneling of resources, Thirtrae was reassigned to a new post:  a high-security construction facility.  They are going to rebuild the SunKiller, and destroying a second one will not be nearly as easy as the first. Now Katarn must take part in a complex operation at Thirtrae's mercenary-guarded estate; the ultimate goal being the elimination of the madman himself."
