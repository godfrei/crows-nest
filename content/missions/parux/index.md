description: "Intelligence has just discovered a massive Imperial energy mine on the planet Parux. The mine drains the geothermal energy from the planet and then uses it to power all the tools of the Imperial war machine, from the mightiest Star Destroyer to the smallest blaster. You job is to shut down the tap into the energy well, then place a sequencer charge in the core. The buildup of energy will eventually become so great that the facility and half the planet will be destroyed."
