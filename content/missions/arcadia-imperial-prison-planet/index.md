description: "The Empire has just destroyed a Rebel Platform base orbiting the planting Dantooine. Many of the Rebel personnel were captured during the attack. The prisoners were shipped off to the planet ARCADIA. The Empire uses this planet as a prison facility. Just a few days later, a Imperial shuttle was detected leaving the planet, it is believed that the Empire is using these prisoners as some kind of experiment to developed a new kind of weapon. It is most likely that the prisoners were on that shuttle. But in order for us to save the prisoners, we need to find were that shuttle is heading. You are to infiltrate the Imperial Prison and find some kind of navigation data. Then you are to return to the landing zone. We will be flying A-Wings for this mission, because we will need there speed to get out of the planet & return to the Alliance fleet. So Blue Squadron has agreed to let us use 2 of there A-Wings for this mission..."
