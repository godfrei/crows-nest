description: "Kyle Katarn, a bright young imperial officer has just received his first position at an Alderaanian ore processing plant. Kyle, having been bombarded with imperial propaganda for the past six years, has decided to defect from the Empire. Just as Kyle decides this, President Palpatine declares himself Emperor, and an imperial delegation arrives on Alderaan to oversee the development of metals for a new fighter. Kyle knows that this information would be invaluable to rebel factions, and decides it could give him the cash flow he will desperately need."
