This is one of the better levels I've played as of yet, and for several reasons. The first is the plot. While it really boils down to another recuse the prisoner idea, the author has replaced the prisoner with hostages, and that is somewhat unique. When combined with his setting, this idea takes on a whole new perspective as we are placed in a situation that can be all too real for us in our world.

The second is undoubtedly the great new ideas that the author has added. There are several original things combined with lots of adaptations of old ideas. One of the best things about all this stuff is that the author has included it to serve a purpose, not just be around for the player to see. Examples are the Sam and Max tune he's converted, plus textures, 3DOs, and lots more.

The author also does a great job with the layout of the hotel. There are rooms, banquet halls, and everything you might find in a hotel. And he's also included it as part of a city that you can run around to your hearts' content, and even get lost in if you're not careful. The one gripe I really have about the level is that the textures he's chosen for certain areas don't make me think of a hotel, but more of a prison. It's undoubtedly a hold-over from the previous storyline of rescue the prisoner, but it does punch a hole in the level.

## Overall

I think that this is a great level, starting with the opening cutscene and finishing with the great puzzles throughout the level. You'll want to check this out to get a fresh taste of Dark Forces.
