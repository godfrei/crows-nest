description: "Kyle Katarn has been captured by the Empire while en route to Sullust, his home planet(moon).  He has received information that the Empire is going to destroy a small resistance on that moon, and was to warn them.  It so happens that the Imperial ship that was sent to destroy the Rebels is the ship that captured you. Destroy the weapons array to delay the destruction of the rebel base long enough to warn them."
