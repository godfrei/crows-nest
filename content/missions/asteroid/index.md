description: "An asteroid has been tracked entering the Korrar system. Though a seemingly normal occurence, rebel probes have detected Imperial ships in it's vicinity and also some possible structures on it's surface. Rebel spies claim that the Empire is establishing an attack base on the asteroid, which they plan to use to launch an offensive against the rebellion. Kyle is smuggled onto the asteroid on a small cargo ship delivering supplies. He must enter the facility and disable it's defenses, so that the Rebels can move in and seize control."
