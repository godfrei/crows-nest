Right up front I had a problem with the story: I, too, don't like Dark Troopers being in a level without a good reason. On the other hand, if this level took place DURING the Dark Trooper crisis, it's been argued, this could make perfect sense. The problem with that is I'd kind of half expect them to be in the Arc Hammer. So it's hard to tell whether there are plot flaws or not...

This is a fairly good level, and can spice up a lifeless afternoon. There are no texture matching problems, and it has a few really cool parts. One of these is where you need to get across a chasm filled with water to get to a door. Shoot a button, and the water plants' floodgates open, and you can continue, see picture. Also cool is a part where TIE fighters fly over you, and you can hear their engines roaring. You lose contact with Jan just as she says, "Oh no! Kyle, you'd better look out I just saw ckkghghkghkhgkhkghkgh..." Strangely enough, you never find out for certain what she saw... maybe it was one of the Dark Troopers.

This level ain't flawless though. Nar Shaddaa seems unusually light and pleasent, unlike the dark and forbidding atmosphere it had earlier. Also there is one part of the level that I could NOT figure out without using a cheat code. It isn't a puzzle, it's a little hole that is impossible to find. It was much too easy to overlook. I'd show you a picture, but then I'd be spoiling the level... you'll know where it is if you play the level. I also detest facing two Phase Two Dark Troopers at a time. This isn't a bug, though, it's just something that took quite a few lives out of my collection. ;)

## Overall

This is what I'd call an above-average mission. It's not phenomenal, but it's not horrendous either. There are very few problems(I was being very nit-picky in the one paragraph), it's a pretty fun level, and is a good time-killer.
