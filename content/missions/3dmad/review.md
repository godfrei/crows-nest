Due to the extraordinary nature of the level, this review will differ in format from the rest. There is no plot, and there are no goals to be accomplished. The only difficulty stems from a squad of stormtroopers, and in being able to figure out what exactly is going on.

In true M.C. Escher style, the author has created some impossible but very interesting rooms. Each of the rooms is similar in size but they all have different textures on the walls. The author claims it to be a joke between DFUSE users, and I'll elaborate on it thanks to some kind people(I'm sorry I've forgotten your names. Mail me again please.) who explained the technical side to me. Obviously each of the rooms can't exist the way they appear; in the 3D world it's impossible. Which reveals one problem with the Dark Forces engine, it isn't true 3D. Therefore you can overlap rooms one on top of another and hook them up so that you can pass from one to the next while never actually leaving the same area in space. There is a more detailed explanation available in the Database.

There's no way to rate the level. Mostly because there's nothing else to compare it to. So all I can really say is that if you're interested, it's kind of fun, it won't take up much disk space, and it's a quick download. So you might want to grab it just to see if you can figure it out.
