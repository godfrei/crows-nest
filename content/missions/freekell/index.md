description: "The Empire maintains a secure processing facility on Kell Island, one of the few remaining natural habitats for the Kell Dragon. At this facility the Kells are slaughtered routinely. Their hides, bones, and flesh are then turned into armor, food, and other resources elemental to Imperial troop operations. The location of this facility was supplied to the Alliance by Whitestar, the conservationist group concerned about the Kell's dwindling numbers. Your mission is to sabotage the facility."
