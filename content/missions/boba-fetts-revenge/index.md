description: "The reputation of Boba Fett is known throughout the galaxy. A true threat to be reckoned with, he had never been defeated... until he met Kyle Katarn. Now he has tracked you down, and is holding you captive in the palace of Durga the Hutt. Sitting in the small room, you plan your escape. Armed with only a small explosive to free you from your cell and your two fists, you know the odds are against you reaching your ship. But then you wouldn't have them any other way."
