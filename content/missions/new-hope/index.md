description: "The Empire have taken Han Solo to the Death Star 95. Spies tell us that he is still carbon frozen.  R2-D2 and C-3PO are also with him. To trick the Empire the plans are in 3PO this time. We also believe that R2 may have been compromised. The Empire are believed to have installed *the latest* operating system in him."
