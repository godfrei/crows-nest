description: "Recently, a mining facility on the planet Terrak VI unearthed an ancient citadel containing manuscripts of what appears to be writings about a Jedi Crystal. Even as we speak, the Empire is translating and encoding the manuscripts to the facility's central mainframe. Gain access to the base and find the main computer, make a copy of the information on a tape and leave with little evidence you were there."
