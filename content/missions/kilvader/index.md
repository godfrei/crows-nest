description: "On board the Victory-Class Star Destroyer Audacity, Darth Vader is touring the perimeter systems for the Emperor. You have been given the job of sneaking aboard the ship and assassinating Lord Vader. This is vital, because Vader will continue to decimate the Jedi Knights if not stopped. Once Vader has been taken care of, you are to place a single charge to destory the Star Destroyer to keep it from continuing in its mission even without Vader. Planting the charge will also cover your escape, as everyone will be too busy trying to save the ship to stop you."
