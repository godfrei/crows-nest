description: "It is after the destruction of the Arc Hammer. The Alliance has learned of a secret supply base where cloning tanks, left over from the Clone Wars, still exist (i.e., Zahn novels).However the Empire is aware that the Rebels have discovered its location. The Imperials may have already moved the tanks to another location. Your mission is to find the tanks and the blueprints to the tanks. If the tanks have not already been moved, set a charge in the main reactor, and get back to your ship and off the planet before the place goes sky high. However, don't forget the blueprints."
