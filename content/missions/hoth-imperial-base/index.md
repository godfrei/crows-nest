description: "For some time now, we have been tracking Smuggler AND Imperial craft going in and out of the recently abandoned planet Hoth. These are mostly freighters and stock-light cruisers. We suspect a weapons trade between these two. We've supplied you with a older Imperial clearence code, and a cargo of energy packs, to pass yourself off as a smuggler. They won't be fooled for long, so MOVE it once you land."
