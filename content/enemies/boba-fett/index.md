title: "Boba Fett"
---

Has anyone in the galaxy not heard of this legendary bounty hunter? Quite easily the most famous mercenary of his time, Boba Fett lives up to the reputation given him. Fast moving and firing, he can kill before you even know he's there. His jet pack gives him the upper hand(literally) and his rockets are devastating. If this guy have been assigned to hunt you down, the best advice is to run.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - If there's any way to avoid this guy, then do it. But if you're forced into a confrontation listen for his tell-tale chuckle that signals he's found you. And then start moving. Boba Fett is easily the most agressive of the enemies you'll meet, and you want him out in the open. He's faster than you so your best shot is to get a bead on him and keep pulling the trigger. If you hit him he'll temporarily lose his jet power and fall a short ways before climbing again, and once you've inflicted enough damage he might just have to stop and get his bearings by hovering for a while. That provides an easy target, so lay into him with any heavy artillery you have. For this guy, fast firing weapons are the best and if there's a weapon supercharge around you'll have an added bonus.
