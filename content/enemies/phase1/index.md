The Phase I is the first stage of Dark Trooper construction and is essentially an endoskeleton. It attacks with a metal blade that your shields can do nothing against, and also has the ability to block energy weapons with a small shield on the left arm. Fast and deadly - listen for the tell-tale buzz to announce their activation.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Keep moving! Don't let these guys get close enough to hit you. TDs are the best to use on the Phase Is if you have enough room to move around, but in close quarters a laser rifle can take them out fairly easily. Just keep you finger on the trigger and watch out for any ricochets from the shield.
