title: "Imperial Officer"
---

The Imperial Officer is a pretty weak adversary, but in numbers can pose a threat. They sport a pistol that makes them more accurate than their Stormtrooper comrades, but slightly less dangerous. They aren't very fast and have no special means of attack.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Like most Imperial Troops, keep them at a distance. Use the Bryar Pistol or Repeater Rifle to pick them off from long range before they can do much damage; TDs or Mortars are useful for larger groups at medium distances or if the group is above or below you.
