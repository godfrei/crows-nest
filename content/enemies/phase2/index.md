title: "Phase II Dark Trooper"
---

The Phase II represents the second stage of Dark Trooper construction. They are armed with an assault cannon which fires plasma and missiles; combine that with their jet packs and high speed attacks and you get a very vicious foe. They like to fire off steady streams of plasma but have to stand still to do so; a missile is usually launched immediately upon noticing you, unless they're close enough that they'd damage themselves.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Movement is even more essential here than with the Phase Is. But it's more important to move back and forth to avoid the plasma and be ready to run away fast to stay out of range of missile explosions. It's never a good idea to get your back to a wall when facing these guys. Missiles do well for long range, and plasma can take them out fairly quickly. The Repeater is probably the best weapon here; keep firing in their direction as they stand still to launch plasma and strafe back and forth quickly to avoid incoming fire. This works best in the medium to close range.
