The Commandos are drawn from the Officer corps, but their physical training makes them faster and more aggressive, and the [laser rifle](/database/weapons/stormtrooper-rifle) they use gives them a longer range but less accuracy. These gray-uniformed enemies are the toughest in the human Imperial ranks.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - The same applies to the Commandos as for [Officers](/database/enemies/imperial-officer) and [Stormtroopers](/database/enemies/stormtrooper): get them at long range or before they notice you're there. Surprise or an accurate long-range attack are your best advantages.
