title: "Mousebot"
---

Mousebots are primarily used in large facilities as guides for visitors, or in military installations for troop coordination. They have very low intelligence, mostly just moving around and beeping, and pose no threat at all to you. Some mousebots have been known to exhibit some flaws in their programming, hiding themselves away in ventilation shafts or other like areas.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Don't worry about mousebots for the most part. They can't hurt you so when you're in a hurry they aren't worth your time. But if you are running low on power they'll drop a battery when destroyed. Look down and fire to hit them, or crouch to come down to their level. One shot at close range from any weapon will do them in.
