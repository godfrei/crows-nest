"Only Imperial Stormtroopers are so precise."

Well that's what they say, but the truth is that these guys couldn't hit a star cruiser unless they were standing three feet away. With their innacurate rifles these guys aren't anything of a threat from long range, but in close quarters and in numbers they can be a nuisance. Two words: cannon fodder.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Take them out with the [Concussion Rifle](/database/weapons/stouker-concussion-rifle) in groups, or use the [Repeater](/database/weapons/imperial-repeater-rifle) to pick them off one at a time. Getting to them before they close the distance or notice you is the key objective here.
