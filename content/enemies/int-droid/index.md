title: "Interrogation Droid"
---

These spherical orbs are the Empire's primary tool in extracting information or confessions from helpless prisoners. They hover above the ground and have pretty good vertical motion, but their horizontal speed is fairly slow. They come equipped with a stun device and a power blast.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - Don't get too close to these guys. The stun device will punch right through your shields and it's difficult to get a bead on them in close quarters. The droids are horrible shots with the power blast so use TDs or the Repeater to take them out from long distances.
