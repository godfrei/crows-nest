title: "Remote"
---

Remotes are small spherical droids that move with quick jerks. They don't pack much of a punch with their laser, but they are very good at avoiding incoming fire. Mostly they're just a large annoyance.

**Suggested Method of Attack** - You'll need an accurate energy weapon to take these guys out, and you'll want to get them before they get too close. Once they're within range they don't really constitute a threat to your life, but they sure are hard to hit. If you have somewhere to hide behind drop a Detonator and then back up and let the remote get blown to pieces.
