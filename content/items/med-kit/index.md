title: "Med Kit"
---

Kyle Katarn has two defensive stats, shields and health, and the med kits you find around the missions will replenish his health. Each med kit restores 20 points, up to the maximum of 100.

Med kits aren't dropped by any of your adversaries, so you'll have to keep an eye out for the distinctive red cross lying around the levels.
