title: "Shield Units"
---

Your shields are your primary defense against the forces of the Empire and various mercenaries you'll encounter. They won't do much against physical attacks like a bite, but they'll take the brunt of any energy-based damage that gets directed your way.

Each unit will restore 20 points to your shields up to a maximum of 200, so keep an eye out for that green glow.
