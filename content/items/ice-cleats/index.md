title: "Ice Cleats"
---

This pair of sharp-looking footwear really only came in handy during one mission of the original Dark Forces, but the community's obsession with recreating all aspects of the Battle of Hoth means you'll find plenty of use for them when playing through the extra missions available.

The cleats provide a bit of extra grip so when walking on ice (or other slippery surfaces) you'll have the same traction as you do on regular terrain.

Just like the goggles and air mask, once you find the cleats they'll remain in your inventory, and you can equip them at any time.
