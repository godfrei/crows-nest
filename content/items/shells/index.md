**Used In:** [Packered Mortar Gun](/database/weapons/packered-mortar-gun)

Shells are scaled down versions of the mortars used on the battle field and are especially suited for the hand-held Mortar Gun. The shells explode on impact with a solid object and pack a pretty powerful punch. You won't find any enemies carrying these around, so look to armories as your best bet. You can find them in singles or in packs of 5.
