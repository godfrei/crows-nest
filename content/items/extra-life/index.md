title: "Extra Life"
---

Though the concept of "lives" has fallen by the wayside in most games nowadays, Dark Forces is from a time when you only had a set number of chances to complete a given mission. Extra lives are few and far between and you'll have to hunt a little bit to uncover them. Finding one of these spinning in a dark carvern means you have a safety net if you want to try being a little more aggressive in your approach.
