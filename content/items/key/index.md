title: "Key"

Another throwback mechanic, sometimes in Dark Forces you need to find the matching color key in order to progress past a locked door. Usually dropped by [Imperial Officers](/database/enemies/imperial-officer), keys come in red, blue, and yellow varieties. They aren't consumable and remain in your inventory once you acquire them.
