title: "Plasma Cartridges"

Used In: Assault Cannon
Plasma has never really been effectively used in a weapon until it was developed as part of the top secret Dark Trooper Project so the cartridges are few and far between, just like the Assault Cannons they're used in. Each cartridge contains enough plasma for 20 rounds. You can sometimes find a few in Imperial armories, or else you can collect them from any Dark Troopers you manage to take down.
