Energy Units are the standard ammunition for laser weapons, and as such they can be found in abundance wherever you go, especially Imperial installations. Each clip contains 15 units. You can also liberate the clips from the rifles your opponents drop. You can hold a maximum of 500 Energy Units at any given time. You can usually get some Energy Units from [Stormtroopers](/database/enemies/stormtrooper), [Commandos](/database/enemies/imperial-commando) and [Imperial Officers](/database/enemies/imperial-officer).
