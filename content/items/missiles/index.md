**Used In:** [Assault Cannon](/database/weapons/assault-cannon)

The Missile is essentially a small rocket with an explosive device attached to the front. It has an unlimited range as far as anyone knows, and explodes upon contact. You can find missiles in racks of 5 or singly, but they're pretty scarce. The only enemies who will ever drop them are [Phase II Dark Troopers](/database/enemies/phase-ii-dark-trooper). You can store only 20 missiles at once for the Assault Cannon.
