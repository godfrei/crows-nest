**Ammo Used:** [Power Cells](/database/items/power-cells) (1 Cell per Fire, Primary; 8 per Fire, Secondary)<br />
**Secondary Fire:** Fires all four barrels at once in a cone trajectory. 

The fusion cutter is a four barreled hand held tool used in construction and in mining to cut through rock. This particular model is made by Jeron, a large and well-known manufacturer of anything from cutters to hydrospanners. The fusion cutter has two settings for use. The first fires each barrel seperately while the second unleashes all four barrels in a cone-shaped trajectory. The first is used for standard mining, the second for when you need a more powerful burst of energy.

While primarily use for construction the cutter can serve as a weapon with little or no modification. It doesn't have a very fast repeat-fire rate(4 shots/s) but is reasonably accurate and each of the green energy bolts is slightly more powerful than a laser or the [repeater's](/database/weapons/imperial-repeater-rifle) bolts. It's best used for the four-barrel burst in close range; that will take out just about any common enemy and it is especially effective against [probe droids](/database/enemies/probe-droid). Beware, though, because each burst will eat up eight energy cells, making it costly when used too often.
