**Ammo Used:** None.<br />
**Secondary Fire:** None. 

While never really the best weapon of choice, sometimes your fists are all you have to work with. Other times they do come in handy. And sometimes you might just enjoy a good brawl. As an advantage your fists don't use up any ammo; this can be nice where you're in a tight spot and want to save some cells for later. Your fists also have about the same strength as your average blaster. But on the other hand they have almost a zero range, which makes it easy for your enemies to pick you off before you even get near enough to punch them.
                    
There's not really a good situation to use your fists in unless your ammo is really running low. But when it becomes necessary, by choice or otherwise, you need to use speed for the fists to be effective. Getting in quickly and hitting an enemy fast will keep them from shooting at you. If your enemy only uses weapons that require close proximity as well, then you can duck in and out of range to get in your punches while avoiding them. But if you're up against a [Dark Trooper Phase II](/database/enemies/phase-ii-dark-trooper) or [Boba Fett](/database/enemies/boba-fett) and all you have is fists..... run for your life.
