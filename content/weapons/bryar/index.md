**Ammo Used:** [Energy Units](/database/items/energy-units) (1 Unit per Fire)<br />
**Secondary Fire:** None.

The Bryar Pistol is really just a Bryar Rifle with the barrel and muzzle shortened(note the clarification of 'modified'). Hardly state of the art, it is usually found in antique gun collections, but is also used by various mercenaries. A reliable blaster, it has a very high degree of accuracy and packs a stronger and more efficient punch to it's bolts than the standard [Stormtrooper Rifle](/database/weapons/stormtrooper-rifle). It does have a fairly slow repeat-fire rate(2 shots/s) and like any laser weapon it's impact decreases over distance.

The pistol is best used over medium range against lower end enemies. The accuracy of the weapon allows you to pick off your enemies with relative ease without letting them get close enough to become a real danger. Very useful in the right situations and good to fall back on when you start to run low on ammo since it isn't as greedy as the Stormtrooper Rifle.
