There are a couple items I need to address here:

First, swgamers.com FTP is down, and will be down for a while. That means that most of the files are inaccesible from here, though a few levels are still stored locally. Bryant tells me he's looking at various hosting services. I don't know when the FTP will come back up, so in the meantime I can only apologize for the inconvenience.

Second, the Nest will be moving to swgamers.com as it's permanent home. I don't know how often it will be updated, but probably not too often. Jedi Knight and my JK page, the Academy, are now the objects of my web/game work. A few people have offered to take over the Nest and update it. But I have to say no for various reasons I won't go into. Suffice to say that the Nest will stick around and provide the same stuff it's always provided, just without being current anymore.
