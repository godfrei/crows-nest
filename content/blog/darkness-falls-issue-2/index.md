![Bein's World Award](./beins_world_award.png)

The Nest received another award while I was on vacation. It's been given the Bein's World Award for being a cool site. I'm going to need to set up an extra section for these!

The second issue of Darkness Falls is out! For those who don't yet know, Darkness Falls is a monthly online magazine devoted to Dark Forces and Jedi Knight. It features interviews, level info and inside news. You can find it at [Bespin - The Cloud City]().

News from the Nest - there are two new reviews, again from Steve Noall and myself. This time we've reviewed [A Jedi Night](/missions/jedinight/).

I also fixed some links to levels, thank you to those who mailed me concerning them.
