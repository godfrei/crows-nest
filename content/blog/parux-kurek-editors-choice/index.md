As promised, some new updates today. First I have awarded [Energy Mine on Parux](/missions/parux/) and [Mt. Kurek](/missions/mtkurek/) Editor's Choice Awards, meaning that they are among the best Dark Forces Add-On missions you can find. If you haven't yet, I suggest you read their reviews and then download them.

Also there are two new reviews of a fairly new mission, [The Rock - Gandolo IV](/misisons/rock), the first of a series if I remember correctly. The level is also set up for you to download from either [Storage](/storage) or from the review page.

Lastly, past updates and new are now found on the History page. Everything new is still here at the front, but now there's a page you can look through if you missed something. You'll always be able to find a link to it in either the [Database](/database/) or at the bottom of this page.
