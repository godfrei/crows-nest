First, that news I mentioned yesterday. Lionel Fouillen contacted me with news about his Archangel Part III. He says that he found time and creativity enough to work on it more and it will be available in October. Apparently there's been some concern that the series was never to be finished; Lionel asked me to help clear that up. So never fear! Also, hopefully there will be a new level out this weekend; it looks promising to me.

I don't think I mentioned it, and it might be old news, but Peter Klassen made some cutscenes for [Assassinate Darth Vader](/missions/kilvader/). I've tried them and they're very cool. Grab them from the review or in [Storage](/storage/).

Today I added a new [review of Castle Wolfenstein](/missions/wolf/) and linked it and Fortress Dantooine, a level from David Lovejoy, for download in [Storage](/storage/). You should check them out if you get a chance!
